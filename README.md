## About

In this assignment, I used D3 in javascript to build an interactive scatterplot that explores three health risk factors (obesity, smoking, healthcare coverage) and compares them to three demographic metrics (poverty, age, household income) by state.  The dataset is stored in a local csv file.

The plot includes interactive x and y axes. The y-axis contains the risk factors that can be selected. When a new risk factor is selected the marker locations, y-axis scaling, and 
tool tip are all updated. They x-axis has the same built in functionality for the demographic information.

Below the plot, I point out some observations and provide some possible reasons for each relationship.
