          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>
          <p>Lack of healthcare coverage appears to have strong correlations with poverty, age and household income. This makes
            sense because people are less likely to pay for healthcare if they are in poverty. Instead, they will spend their money
            on more immeadiate issues like food, water and shelter. Younger individuals are also less likely to have a job with 
            healthcare coverage or have additional dollars to spend on healthcare because they have had less time to develop their
            career. Additionally, younger people are most likely healthier, so obtaining coverage is not as high of a priority.
          </p>

          <p>Smoking does not have a clear correlation with age. It is interesting to note that a higher percentage of poverty
            correlates with a higher smoking percentage. Household income is inversely correlated with smoking percentage. I do not
            have a great explanation for this. It is interesting to note that Utah is a potential outlier with a very low percentage
            of the population that smokes.
          </p>

          <p>Obesity does not discrimnate by age. There is a loose positive correlation with obesity and poverty rate. However, the 
            strongest correlation is household income. It is a strong positive correlation. I believe this could possibly be attributed
            to quality of food in diet. Fresh, healthy food is typically more expensive.
